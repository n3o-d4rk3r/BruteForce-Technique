This is BruteForce Tutorials for beginners. Now, what is meaning of BruteForce? "Savage violence, unreasoning strength, as in We hope that reason will triumph over brute force. Although this expression is also used literally to mean exceptional physical power, the figurative sense reflects the origin for brute, which comes from Latin brutus, for â€œheavy, stupid, unreasoning."
